A simple application that lets you play a xylophone.

# Introduction
Now this a again an simple app which I made to play audio with the help of an imported package , new things in the code I learnt are using function to return widget , passing widgets or different class objects as a named parameter and make my code less repitative. 
New things I will introduce
